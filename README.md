# funny-game
A test game made with raylib to get use to game development

Hello yes, this project works now.
Run the executable with any command line argument to open in window mode (to view console).

! I downloaded raylib from the github repo and am linking the files directly in my Makefile, so the Makefile probably wont work for you !
! The raylib files aren't actually in this repo !

KNOWN ISSUES:
